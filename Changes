        - Server name of production server
        - Honor test_transaction mode in submit, by overriding user/pass,
          as well as setting server name to QA server.
        - Check HTTP errors.
        - Set avs-code.
        - Use ResponseCode rather than ISO for result-code.
          We do not have enough info about "ISO" response codes to make use
          of them.  There may be good reasons why the ISO codes could be
          preferable, but we would need more information.
          For now, the ResponseCode.
        - Use AuthCode rather then Txn-number for authorization.
        - Remove extra spaces and other odd characters in Message.
